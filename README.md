# üì° BLE Touch Sensor Logger

This project enables wireless touch detection using an **Arduino Nano 33 BLE** and a **Python data logger** via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It detects touches using a capacitive sensor and logs events in real-time to a CSV file.

## üõ† Hardware & Software

- Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- Capacitive touch sensor (with 10MŒ© resistor between send and receive pins)
- PC/Mac with Bluetooth and Python 3.7+
- BLE-enabled host (tested with `bleak` on Linux/macOS)

## Getting Started

### 1. Flash the Arduino

- Open `ble_touch/ble_touch.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
- Set board to **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**.
- Connect and upload the sketch.

## Python Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following:

```
bleak
matplotlib
```

Install via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
### 2. Run the Python Logger

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:
for live plotting:
```bash
python live_receive.py

for CSV and saved plots:
```bash
python ble_receive.py
---

### 3. Controls

| Key | Action                    |
|-----|---------------------------|
| `r` | Toggle recording          |
| `q` | End session & save file   |

CSV files will be saved with timestamps and session names.

---

## BLE UUIDs

Make sure these match in both Arduino and Python files:

```python
MESSAGE_SERVICE_UUID = "19B10000-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214"
MESSAGE_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = "19B10001-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214"
```

---

## Features

- BLE communication from Arduino to host
- Real-time capacitive touch detection
- Toggle-able CSV logging
- Timestamped event data
- Optional plotting using matplotlib


---

## Future Improvements

- Add real-time plotting
- GUI interface for session control
- Adaptive thresholding or touch calibration UI
